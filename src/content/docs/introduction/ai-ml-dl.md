title: AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
description: Understanding the nested relationship between AI, ML, and DL.
---

One of the most common points of confusion for those starting in the field is the difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). These terms are not interchangeable; rather, they represent a nested hierarchy of technologies.

## The "Russian Doll" Relationship

The easiest way to visualize the relationship is as a set of nested circles:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broadest category. It includes any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence, whether through logic-based "if-then" rules or more advanced methods.
2. **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI. ML consists of algorithms that use data to improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.
3. **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML. DL uses multi-layered "neural networks" to solve complex patterns in data (like image and speech recognition).

## Key Differences

| Feature | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Machines mimicking human intelligence. | Algorithms that learn from data. | Neural networks with many layers. |
| **Approach** | Can be rule-based or data-driven. | Primarily data-driven. | Data-intensive; mimics human brain. |
| **Data Needs** | Varies (Can be very low). | Medium to High. | Extremely High (Big Data). |
| **Hardware** | General-purpose CPUs. | CPUs or light GPUs. | Heavy GPUs/TPUs required. |

## Which One Should You Use?

Generally, the choice depends on your problem:

- Use **AI** (Rule-based) for simple logic where the rules are clear and unchanging (e.g., a simple chatbot flow).
- Use **ML** for structured data where you need predictions but don't want to define every rule (e.g., house price prediction).
- Use **DL** for unstructured data like images, video, and audio where patterns are too complex for traditional ML (e.g., self-driving car vision).
