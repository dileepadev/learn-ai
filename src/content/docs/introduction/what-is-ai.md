Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Core Concepts

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written.
- **Computer Vision:** A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

## Why is AI Important?

AI is transforming every industry, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. It enables automation, enhances decision-making, and creates new opportunities for innovation.
