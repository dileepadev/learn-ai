title: Types of AI
description: Understanding the different classifications of Artificial Intelligence.
---

Artificial Intelligence can be classified in several ways, often based on its capabilities (Type 1) or its functionality (Type 2).

## Type 1: Based on Capabilities

This classification focuses on how well AI can perform tasks compared to human intelligence.

### 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

Also known as "Weak AI," ANI is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, voice assistants, or playing chess). All current AI systems, including LLMs like ChatGPT, are considered Narrow AI because they operate within a limited context.

### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Also known as "Strong AI," AGI refers to a machine that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from a human across any intellectual task. AGI does not yet exist.

### 3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

ASI is a hypothetical level of AI that surpasses human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.

## Type 2: Based on Functionality

Proposed by Arend Hintze, this classification looks at how the AI processes information.

- **Reactive Machines:** The simplest form of AI. They do not store memories or use past experiences to inform future actions (e.g., IBM's Deep Blue).
- **Limited Memory:** AI that can look into the past to make better decisions. Most modern AI, including self-driving cars and chatbots, falls into this category.
- **Theory of Mind:** A hypothetical type of AI that can understand human emotions, beliefs, and intentions.
- **Self-Aware AI:** The ultimate stage of AI development where the machine has its own consciousness and self-awareness. This remains purely speculative.
