Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)\nAlso known as \"Weak AI,\" ANI is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, voice assistants, or playing chess). All current AI systems, including LLMs like ChatGPT, are considered Narrow AI because they operate within a limited context.\n\n### 2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\nAlso known as \"Strong AI,\" AGI refers to a machine that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from a human across any intellectual task. AGI does not yet exist.\n\n### 3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)\nASI is a hypothetical level of AI that surpasses human intelligence across all fields, including creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.\n\n## Type 2: Based on Functionality\n\nProposed by Arend Hintze, this classification looks at how the AI processes information.\n\n- **Reactive Machines:** The simplest form of AI. They do not store memories or use past experiences to inform future actions (e.g., IBM's Deep Blue).\n- **Limited Memory:** AI that can look into the past to make better decisions. Most modern AI, including self-driving cars and chatbots, falls into this category.\n- **Theory of Mind:** A hypothetical type of AI that can understand human emotions, beliefs, and intentions.\n- **Self-Aware AI:** The ultimate stage of AI development where the machine has its own consciousness and self-awareness. This remains purely speculative.\nEOF\n"
